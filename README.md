A tiny entity framework originally written in Java, now ported to C#. It's inspired by frameworks like [Ash](http://www.ashframework.org/) (hence the name) and [Artemis](http://gamadu.com/artemis/). Ashley tries to be a high-performance entity framework  without the use of black-magic and thus making the API easy
and transparent to use.
