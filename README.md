A tiny entity framework originally written in Java, now ported to C#. It's inspired by frameworks like [Ash](http://www.ashframework.org/) (hence the name) and [Artemis](http://gamadu.com/artemis/). Ashley tries to be a high-performance entity framework  without the use of black-magic and thus making the API easy
and transparent to use.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project relies on [SharpGDX](https://github.com/SharpGDX/SharpGDX). In the future it may have this dependency removed, but as this was a port of a Java library, specifically for SharpGDX, it is ported as is and retains this dependency.

> [!NOTE]
> This is a conversion of the libGDX Ashley, located [here](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley), to work with SharpGDX. All original code and assets belong to their respective owners.
